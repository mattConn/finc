create initial output:
open file
copy file chars to nested array
	size array for lines, for characters.
		on newline:
			find largest line char count via comparison
			add to line count
		nested array: arr[linecount][max-char-count]
	
	after sizing, push to array
		index counter
		push to array, increment index char

======================= ^ DONE ^ ==========================================


check for directives in nested array

catalog directives locations:
	find directives, count directives, size directives location array
	find directives again, add indices to location array

======================= ^ DONE ^ ==========================================

create nested directive file array
	size this array: is size of directive count
	nested arrays are sized: largest file
	open each file, push characters to respective nested array
	
size final output array:
	add size of current output to int.
	open each file by directive location, count characters and add to size int 

Loop over array, strcat line to final
	if directive, strcat that item, increment index
